# DevOps-Notes

## Overview
A central repository for my learning notes, cheat sheets, and references across DevOps topics. This repo consolidates everything I’ve studied — from shell scripting to Git, Linux, DevOps and beyond — into one place for quick access and sharing.
I will keep adding things as I explore more.

## Contents
* Linux
* Shell Scripting
* Networking
* Git & GitHub

## Purpose
This repo serves as a knowledge hub — a place to store my personal notes, cheat sheets, and references. 
It’s designed to be:
**Practical:** quick lookup during projects or interviews
**Reusable:** modular notes that can be extended as I learn more
**Organized:** structured by topic for easy navigation
